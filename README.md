# ABC
Approximate Bayesian Computation on hybrid simulations - subsumed into HybridSim. The 'main' for HybridSim is here.

Initially designed to do approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), it turned out that it works better to
do just the simulation and summary statistics calculation with this program, and leave the ABC selection of
data points to be done later in R.
