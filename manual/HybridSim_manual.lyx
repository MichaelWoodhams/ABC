HybridSim Manual

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HybridSim is a simulator for generating phylogenies in the presence of hybridiza
tion.
 It operates in two modes.
 In simple mode, it outputs a single reticulate phylogeny plus a set of
 trees.
 In statistics mode, it simulates many reticulate phylogenies and outputs
 a set of statistics derived from each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Input files are in Nexus format.
 In simple mode, the output Nexus file includes input blocks specifying
 the parameters of the simulation -- thus the file contains not only the
 output of the program, but records the exact input that produced this output,
 and so is fully self documenting.
 The output file can even be used as an input file, in which case HybridSim
 will throw out all of the output blocks and regenerate them.
 (HybridSim is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

idempotent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this mode: using the output of one run as the input to another run will
 produce identical output.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HybridSim uses a lightly modified version of the PAL library version 1.5.1
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PAL"

\end_inset

, and BioJava version 1.8.4
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BioJava"

\end_inset

 for Nexus file parsing.

Simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mathematical details behind HybridSim are described in more detail in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HybridSim"

\end_inset

, but in this section we give a brief recapitulation.
 HybridSim is a forwards-in-time simulator of reticulate phylogenies, allowing
 two types of reticulation (hybridization and introgression), with the probabili
ty of hybridization being a function of genetic distance, with rates of
 various processess varying with time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Terminology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Epoch HybridSim allows some parameters to vary with time, as a series of
 step functions.
 An epoch is a period of time within which all parameters are constant.
 Parameters can change value only at the boundaries between epochs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Gene
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Tree A gene tree represents the phylogeny of a given gene.
 It is derived from a lineage tree (which defines the phylogeny of the locus
 at which the gene sits) by a lineage sorting/coalescent random process.
 Nodes on the gene tree always predate the corresponding node in the lineage
 tree (or network), and it may have differet topology to the lineage tree
 which generated it, due to incomplete lineage sorting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Hybridization An event where a new species is formed with its initial geneome
 being derived from two parent species.
 Some proportion of its initial genome comes from one parent, the remainder
 from the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Introgression An event where a species has some proportion of its genome
 overwritten by that of another species.
 (This may be caused by hybrid individuals who then enter the gene pool
 of the introgressed species.) This could also be called a horizontal gene
 transfer event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Lineage
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Tree A tree (embedded in the network) representing the lineage of a given
 locus.
 At each reticulation event, the lineage will inherit from one of the parent
 species only.
 Nodes on the lineage tree correspond exactly to speciation and hybridization
 events in the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Network A reticulate phylogeny, i.e.
 a phylogeny including hybridization and introgression events
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Reticulation Either a hybridization or introgression (i.e.
 any node in the network with in-degree greater than one represents an instance
 of reticulation.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Nexus File Format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HybridSim takes a Nexus file as input.
 This Nexus file will contain a hybridsim block and may also contain a hybridABC
grid block.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the hybridABCgrid block is absent, HybridSim works in its simple mode
 of operation, each run produces a single random network.
 Output is a Nexus file containing the network (in extended Newick format
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "extNewick"

\end_inset

) and several sets of trees, as well as the input parameters.
 It can also (depending on input parametes) simulate a Dollo process which
 will result in a characters block.
 A distances block records the average genetic distance between taxa (i.e.
 terminal nodes in the network.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the hybridABCgrid block is present, HybridSim will generate many networks,
 and for each network a number of gene trees.
 It will output summary statistics for each network's set of gene trees
 into a (non-Nexus) text file.
 (In principle, a Nexus characters block could contain this information,
 but coaxing Biojava to produce something useful was very hard.
 I could revisit this, if there is demand.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
HybridSim input block
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hybridsim block contains a list of <parameter>=<value> pairs.
 Parameter names are not case sensitive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some parameters can change their value with time - they are piecewise constant
 functions.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

epochs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 parameter specifies the times at which other parameters may change their
 values.
 It contains a parenthesis-delimited monotonically increasing list of non-negati
ve real numbers.
 Time variable parameters specify a list of values, of length one greater
 than the length of the epochs list.
 For example we could have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

epochs = (0.5,1)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

speciation rate = (5,3,1)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, indicating that speciation rate is 5 up to time 0.5, rate is 3 between
 0.5 and 1, and rate is 1 thereafter.
 A single value may be specified where a list is expected, in which case
 that value holds for all epochs.
 In the above example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coalescence rate = (10)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is synonymous with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coalescence rate = (10,10,10)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some values are discrete distributions, which are a list of value-weight
 pairs.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

(0.1,2,0.2,1)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 specifies a distribution which will evaluate to 0.1 twice as often as it
 evaluates to 0.2.
 (The distribution 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

(0.1,10,0.2,5)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is exactly synonymous to the above.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comments can be added inside square brackets, as normal for a Nexus file.
 These comments will not get reproduced in the output Nexus file.

\end_inset

In this example, we have two epochs, first from 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1$
\end_inset

, then for 
\begin_inset Formula $t>1$
\end_inset

 (line 3).
 Speciation occurs at rate 3 during the first epoch and rate 0.5 in the second
 epoch (line 4).
 Hybridization does not occur (rate 0) in the first epoch and has rate 2
 (per pair of species) in the second (line 5).
 Introgression never occurs (line 6).
 New hybrids get 50-50 gene contributions from their parents 50% of the
 time, 75-25 contribution 25% of the time and 10-90 25% of the time (line
 7).
 As introgression rate is zero, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

introgression distribution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is immaterial and we have not specified it.
 The chance of an attempted reticulation succeeding linearly decreases (line
 9) from 100% at genetic distance of zero, to 0% at genetic distance of
 1 (line 8).
 The generated network will have exactly two reticulation events (lines
 10 and 11.) 250 gene trees (line 19) will be generated by a coalescent process
 (line 12), with coalescence rate 6 (line 13) at all epochs.
 The generated network will have 20 leaf taxa (line 15) (unless the halt
 time of 20 (14) or maximum reticulations (prior to being reduced) of 30
 (line 16) occur first, which on these parameters is unlikely.) No Dollo
 data will be produced (line 17, could be omitted as this is the default.)

HybridABCGrid Nexus Block

\begin_layout Standard
This block is optional.
 It allows running HybridSim multiple times with varying parameters, and
 recording summary statistics from each run.
 In this mode, the output file is a space-delimited table with columns for
 the parameters iterated over and for summary statistics on the generated
 trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like the HybridSim block, it consists of <parameter> = <value> pairs.
 Any valid parameter for HybridSim can be a HybridABCGrid parameter.

 is a very general sequence simulation program, able to simulate sequences
 from inhomogeneous models (different DNA models on different branches)
 and reticulate phylogenies (through different trees applying to different
 parts of the sequence.) Filo uses Nexus format for input.
 HybridSim is able to generate a useable Filo input block in its output,
 so HybridSim's output file can be used as an input file to Filo.
 To do this, it is necessary to set ``filo sites per tree'' to a non-zero
 value, and to provide a template Filo block in the HybridSim input file.
 The input Filo block passes through to the output, with the following edits:

Nexus Output Format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there is no HybridABCGrid block, the output will be a Nexus file.
 This file is useable as input to HybridSeq, and if so used will recreate
 itself exactly.
 There are three output trees blocks.
 These are identified with comments.
 The output nexus file will contain blocks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
HybridSeq containing the input parameters to the simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Taxa containing the taxon names for the network, which will be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

B
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Trees The first trees block will exhaustively list the lineage trees with
 their probabilities specified in comments.
 Tree names start with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ELT
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exact lineage tree
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.) This block may be omitted if the number of lineage trees is too large.
 (The number grows exponentially with the number of reticulation events.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Trees The second trees block contains randomly selected (with weight equal
 to their probability) lineage trees.
 The number of randomly selected trees is determined by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

number random trees
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 parameter.
 These trees have names starting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

RLT
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (random lineage tree.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Trees The third trees block contains coalescent (i.e.
 gene) trees derived from the lineage trees of the previous block.
 These trees have names starting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CT
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (coalescent tree.) This block will be absent if parameter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coalesce
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is false.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
eNewick This block specifies the network in 'extended Newick' format.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Distances This block records the average distance between taxa.
 If ``reduce reticulations to'' has non-default value, the Distances block
 is not output.
 (This is because eliminating reticulations modifies the distance matrix
 and there currently is no code to recalculate it correctly when this happens.
 Such code could be added if there is a need for it.)
